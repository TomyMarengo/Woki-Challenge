# Reservation Timeline

## 1) Objective

Design and implement **Reservation Timeline** — a production-ready visual timeline interface for managing restaurant reservations in real-time. The system must:

- Provide an **interactive timeline grid** (time on X-axis, tables on Y-axis)
- Support **drag & drop** for creating, moving, and resizing reservation blocks
- Handle **real-time conflict detection** and visual collision warnings
- Enable **multi-table operations** and bulk scheduling
- Display **color-coded status** with smooth transitions
- Optional: Support **multiple time views** (day, 3-day, week)
- Maintain **60fps performance** with 200+ concurrent reservations

Think of this as the **scheduling interface of a real restaurant management system**: the **CORE** should be shippable in **~4 hours**, and **BONUS** items are where senior engineers demonstrate mastery (auto-scheduling, capacity analytics, etc.).

You may use any framework, libraries, and techniques you deem appropriate (React, timeline libraries, custom canvas, etc.), as long as you justify your choices in the README and credit external sources. The work must be done individually. After submission, you will conduct a brief technical defense: demo the working solution, explain rendering strategy, discuss scheduling algorithms, and answer questions on performance, state management, and UX.

## 2) Time Conventions & Grid System

- **Time slot**: 15 minutes (smallest granularity)
- **Time range**: 11:00 - 00:00 (13 hours = 52 slots)
- **Default reservation duration**: 90 minutes (6 slots)
- **Grid cell**: 1 slot = 60px width on screen (zoomable)
- **Snap behavior**: Drag operations snap to 15-minute boundaries
- **Timezone**: Restaurant's local timezone (configurable)
- **Visual indication**: Current time marker (red line)

## 3) Domain Model

```typescript
type UUID = string;
type ISODateTime = string; // e.g., "2025-10-15T20:00:00-03:00"
type Minutes = number;
type SlotIndex = number; // 0-based, each slot = 15min

type ReservationStatus = 
  | 'PENDING'      // Awaiting confirmation
  | 'CONFIRMED'    // Confirmed, not yet seated
  | 'SEATED'       // Currently at the table
  | 'FINISHED'     // Completed
  | 'NO_SHOW'      // Didn't arrive
  | 'CANCELLED';   // Cancelled

type Priority = 'STANDARD' | 'VIP' | 'LARGE_GROUP';

interface Sector {
  id: UUID;
  name: string;
  color: string;
  sortOrder: number;
}

interface Table {
  id: UUID;
  sectorId: UUID;
  name: string;
  capacity: {
    min: number;
    max: number;
  };
  sortOrder: number; // for Y-axis ordering
}

interface Customer {
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email?: string;
  notes?: string;
}

interface Reservation {
  id: UUID;
  tableId: UUID;
  customer: Customer;
  partySize: number;
  startTime: ISODateTime;
  endTime: ISODateTime;
  durationMinutes: Minutes;
  status: ReservationStatus;
  priority: Priority;
  notes?: string;
  source?: string; // 'phone', 'web', 'walkin', 'app'
  createdAt: ISODateTime;
  updatedAt: ISODateTime;
}

interface TimelineConfig {
  date: string; // "2025-10-15"
  startHour: number; // 11
  endHour: number; // 24 (or 0 for midnight)
  slotMinutes: Minutes; // 15
  viewMode: 'day' | '3-day' | 'week';
}

interface ConflictCheck {
  hasConflict: boolean;
  conflictingReservationIds: UUID[];
  reason?: 'overlap' | 'capacity_exceeded' | 'outside_service_hours';
}
```

## 4) CORE Requirements (target: ~4 hours)

### 4.1 Timeline Grid Rendering
- **Two-axis layout**:
  - **X-axis (horizontal)**: Time slots from 11:00 to 00:00 in 15-min increments
  - **Y-axis (vertical)**: Tables grouped by sector
- **Grid structure**:
  - Header row with time labels (11:00, 11:15, 11:30...)
  - Vertical lines every 30 minutes (bold every hour)
  - Horizontal lines separating tables
  - Sector group headers (collapsed/expandable)
- **Current time indicator**: Red vertical line at current time
- **Scrollable viewport**: Horizontal and vertical scroll with sticky headers

### 4.2 Reservation Blocks
- **Visual blocks** representing reservations:
  - Width = duration (90min = 6 slots = 360px at 1x zoom)
  - Height = table row height (60px)
  - Position = start time (X) + table (Y)
- **Color coding by status**:
  - PENDING: Yellow (#FCD34D)
  - CONFIRMED: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - SEATED: Green (#10B981)
  - FINISHED: Gray (#9CA3AF)
  - NO_SHOW: Red (#EF4444)
  - CANCELLED: Striped gray
- **Block content**:
  - Customer name
  - Party size (icon + number)
  - Time range (20:00-21:30)
  - Priority badge (VIP, Large Group)
- **Hover state**: Show tooltip with full details
- **Selection**: Click to select; multi-select with Cmd/Ctrl + click

### 4.3 Drag & Drop - Create Reservation
- **Click and drag on empty space** to create new reservation:
  1. Mouse down on empty cell → start creating
  2. Drag right → expand duration (snaps to 15-min slots)
  3. Release → open quick-create modal with pre-filled time/table
- **Quick-create modal** fields:
  - Customer name (required)
  - Phone (required)
  - Party size (required)
  - Duration (pre-filled, editable)
  - Status (default: CONFIRMED)
  - Priority (default: STANDARD)
  - Notes
- **Validation**:
  - Party size must be within table capacity
  - Duration minimum 30 minutes, maximum 6 hours
  - Check for conflicts before creating

### 4.4 Drag & Drop - Move Reservation
- **Drag existing block horizontally** → change time (start/end shift together)
- **Drag existing block vertically** → change table
- **Drag both axes** → change both time and table
- **Snap to grid**: Positions snap to 15-minute slots
- **Ghost preview**: Show semi-transparent preview while dragging
- **Conflict detection**: Show red warning if target position conflicts
- **Validation**: Prevent drop if conflict exists or outside service hours
- **Optimistic update**: UI updates immediately; rollback if server rejects

### 4.5 Drag & Drop - Resize Reservation
- **Drag right edge** → extend duration
- **Drag left edge** → change start time + duration
- **Minimum duration**: 30 minutes (2 slots)
- **Maximum duration**: 4 hours (16 slots)
- **Snap to slots**: Edges snap to 15-minute boundaries
- **Real-time duration display**: Show new duration while dragging
- **Conflict check**: Warn if resize causes overlap

### 4.6 Context Menu & Actions
- **Right-click on reservation** → context menu:
  - Edit details (open full modal)
  - Change status → submenu (PENDING, CONFIRMED, SEATED, etc.)
  - Mark as no-show
  - Cancel reservation
  - Duplicate (copy to new time/table)
  - Delete
- **Keyboard shortcuts (optional)**:

  - `Ctrl/Cmd + C` → copy selected
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + V` → paste at current position
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + D` → duplicate selected
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` → undo
  - `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` → redo

### 4.7 Conflict Detection & Validation
- **Real-time conflict checking**:
  - Detect overlapping reservations on same table
  - Warn if party size exceeds table capacity
  - Prevent reservations outside service hours
- **Visual warnings**:
  - Red border on conflicting blocks
  - Warning icon on block
  - Tooltip explaining conflict
- **Conflict resolution**:
  - Auto-suggest alternative tables
  - Auto-suggest alternative times (±15, ±30 min)
  - Manual override option (with confirmation)

### 4.8 Filtering & View Controls
- **Top toolbar**:
  - Date picker (navigate days)
  - Sector filter (multi-select dropdown)
  - Status filter (show/hide by status)
  - Search by customer name/phone
  - Zoom controls (50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%)
- **Sector collapse/expand**: Click sector header to collapse all tables in sector
- **Active filters indicator**: Chip showing active filters with count

## 5) Acceptance Criteria (CORE)

✅ **Timeline Grid**: Renders correctly with time on X-axis, tables on Y-axis; sector grouping works  
✅ **Reservations Display**: All reservation blocks render with correct position, size, color, and content  
✅ **Create**: Can click-drag to create reservation; modal opens with correct pre-filled data  
✅ **Move**: Can drag reservation horizontally (time) and vertically (table); snaps to grid  
✅ **Resize**: Can drag edges to change duration; respects min/max constraints  
✅ **Conflict Detection**: Overlaps are detected and visually indicated; cannot drop on conflict  
✅ **Context Menu**: Right-click shows menu with all actions; actions work correctly  
✅ **Status Changes**: Can change reservation status; color updates immediately  
✅ **Filtering**: Sector, status, and search filters work; view updates in real-time  
✅ **Performance**: Smooth 60fps with 200 reservations; drag operations feel responsive  
✅ **Validation**: Cannot create invalid reservations (wrong capacity, outside hours, conflicts)

## 6) Minimal Test Cases

1. **Happy path**: Click-drag empty cell → create reservation → opens modal → fill form → save → block appears
2. **Move reservation**: Drag block right 1 hour → position updates → no conflict → success
3. **Move to conflict**: Drag block onto existing reservation → red warning → cannot drop
4. **Resize**: Drag right edge → extend 30 min → duration updates → no conflict → success
5. **Change status**: Right-click → Change status to SEATED → color changes to green
6. **Filter by sector**: Select "Terrace" → only Terrace tables shown
7. **Search**: Type customer name → only matching reservations shown
8. **Multi-select**: Cmd+click 3 blocks → all selected → delete → all removed → undo → all restored
9. **Capacity validation**: Try to create 8-person party on 2-person table → shows error
10. **Performance**: Load 200 reservations → scroll smoothly → zoom in/out → no lag
